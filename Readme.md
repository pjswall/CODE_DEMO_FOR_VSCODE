## GitHub Repositories extension

The GitHub Repositories extension allows you to browse, search, edit, and commit to any remote GitHub repository straight from Visual Studio Code, eliminating the need to clone the repository locally. This can be useful in many situations when you only need to inspect source code or make a little update to a file or object.

## Working with GitHub in VS code

GitHub is a cloud-based source code storage and sharing service. When you use GitHub with Visual Studio Code, you can share your source code and collaborate with others directly from your editor. There are other methods to communicate with GitHub, such as through their website at https://github.com or the Git command-line interface (CLI), but the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues addon in VS Code provides the most robust GitHub integration.


Before we begin using GitHub in Visual Studio Code, you must first install Git, register a GitHub account, and install the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension. In this article, we'll show you how to use some of your favourite GitHub features without leaving VS Code.

Start with the Version Control subject if you're new to source control or want to learn more about VS Code's basic Git support.

## Starting with GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

If you are not taken to VS Code, you may manually enter your permission token. Your authorisation token will be shown in the browser window. Return to VS Code and copy the token. In the Status bar, choose Signing in to github.com..., paste the token, and press Enter.

## Setting up a repository

### Cloning a Repository

If you are not taken to VS Code, you may manually enter your permission token. Your authorisation token will be shown in the browser window. Return to VS Code and copy the token. In the Status bar, choose Signing in to github.com..., paste the token, and press Enter.

You may filter and select the repository to clone locally from the GitHub repository selection.

## Opening a repository

After you've installed the GitHub Repositories extension, you may use the GitHub Repositories: Open Repository... using the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) or by clicking the Remote indication in the Status bar's bottom left corner.

When you run the Open Repository command, you may choose whether to open a repository from GitHub, a Pull Request from GitHub, or a previously linked repository.

If you haven't previously entered into GitHub from VS Code, you'll be prompted to sign in using your GitHub account.
You may either enter the repository URL directly or use the text box to search GitHub for the repository you want.

When you pick a repository or Pull Request, the VS Code window reloads and the repository contents appear in the File Explorer. Then, much like working on a local clone of a repository, you may open files (with full syntax highlighting and bracket matching), make revisions, and commit changes.

When you commit a change using the GitHub Repository extension, the changes are sent immediately to the remote repository, just like they would be if you were working in the GitHub web interface.
